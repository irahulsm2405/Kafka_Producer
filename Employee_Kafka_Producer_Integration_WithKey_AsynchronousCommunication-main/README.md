This code represents an integration of kafka with spring boot.

This is only a producer and not consumer.
This project is sending data with key and communicates asynchronously. It means spring boot app will not wait for kafka to respond, it will send a message and continue to function normally.

Technologies: mySQL server 9.3, Java 17, spring boot 3.5.3, Postman and Kafka 3.6.0

Kafka has 3 servers running in cluster.
